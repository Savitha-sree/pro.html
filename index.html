          <h3>Biographies</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Droupadi Murmu was born on June 20, 1958, in Uparbeda, a village
              in Odisha state, to a Santhali tribal family.

            <li>
              Murmu experienced poverty as a child. She completed her primary
              education in the village school, and she subsequently earned a
              Bachelor of Arts degree from Rama Devi Womenâ€™s College in
              Bhubaneswar. She is the first woman from her village to complete a
              university education.
            </li>
            <li>
              Murmu did not fare so well in later elections, being defeated in
              the 2009 federal legislature (Lok Sabha) election for the
              Mayurbhanj constituency as well as the 2014 Odisha state
              legislature election for Rairangpur. She also experienced personal
              losses: one son died in 2009, another in 2013, and her husband in
              2014.
            </li>
            <li>
              From 1979 to 1983, Murmu worked as a junior assistant at the
              irrigation department of the Government of Odisha. From 1994 to
              1997, she then worked as a teacher at the school Sri Aurobindo
              Integral Education and Research Centre in Rairangpur, where she
              taught Hindi, Odia, mathematics, and geography.[19][17] She never
              claimed for a full salary at the school.[9]
